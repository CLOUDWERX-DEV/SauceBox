## 🚀 The Ultimate Feature Set

### 📥 Massive Playlist Support & Selection
Paste a playlist URL and SauceBox instantly pulls all the metadata into a beautiful modal grid. Choose to download the **entire playlist** with one click, or selectively pick and choose only the videos you want.

### 🗄️ Beautiful Video Gallery & Media Management 🏷️
Your `Gallery` tab isn't just a log—it's a fully-fledged video manager. Search through your local archive, view rich metadata, sort your collection, and give videos a **Star Rating**. Use the **Smart Tagging** system to create your own categories (like "Favorites" or "Cinematic") and instantly filter your massive archive to find exactly what you're looking for.

### 💾 Bulletproof Native Storage
SauceBox doesn't rely on volatile browser caches. Your entire database is split into two beautifully formatted, human-readable JSON files (`saucebox-gallery.json` and `saucebox-settings.json`) that are securely written directly to your operating system's native application data directory using atomic file writes. This guarantees your data survives app updates, prevents loss when caches are cleared, makes backups as easy as copying two files, and allows you to manually tweak advanced settings directly in a text editor!

### 🎥 Robust Local Importing
Already have a massive stash on your hard drive? Use the **Import** feature to ingest entire folders or specific files into your SauceBox Gallery. Choose between single-file wizard editing, bulk uniform metadata, or fully automated metadata scraping. SauceBox will use `ffmpeg` to instantly generate high-quality thumbnails, scrape true video durations, extract exact resolutions, and calculate real file sizes for everything you import.

### 🤖 Auto-Tagging & Smart Metadata Extraction
As videos download, SauceBox intelligently extracts metadata on the fly. The **Auto-Tagging** feature automatically categorizes your new videos based on their source domain/provider (e.g., Pornhub, Spankbang), keeping your Gallery clean and organized without lifting a finger. If you ever need to change things, hit the **Edit** button on any card to update Titles, Creators, and Tags on the fly.

### 🎬 Native Playback & Highlight Clipper ✂️
No need to hunt down files in your system explorer. SauceBox features a gorgeous, built-in **In-App Video Player** to watch your files instantly. Only care about a 3-minute scene in a 5GB video? Toggle **Clip Mode**, enter a start time, and instantly use the built-in `ffmpeg` integration to slice out and save that highlight clip without re-encoding!

### ⏸️ Flawless Pause & Resume
Got to go? Click Pause, or just close the app entirely. SauceBox intelligently saves the exact byte position of your active downloads. When you start the app again, it automatically queues your pending downloads so you can resume them flawlessly.

### 🔒 Vault Lock & Deep Stealth Mode 🥷
Absolute privacy is guaranteed. Enable **Vault Mode** in the settings to protect the app behind a 4-digit PIN lock screen on startup. And if someone walks in the room, smash the **Stealth Hotkey** (`Ctrl + Shift + H` by default) to instantly hide the app from the taskbar, pause all active downloads, and mute any playing video. Configure stealth options specifically to your liking.

### 🌐 "Send to SauceBox" Browser Extension
Skip the copy-pasting entirely. Install the included Chrome Companion Extension to simply right-click any video on your favorite tube sites and click "Send to SauceBox", or **click the extension icon** in your toolbar to instantly send the current page URL. The built-in local background server will instantly grab the URL and start downloading it in the app automatically.

### 📡 Media Server & VR Broadcast
SauceBox features a built-in media server that generates dynamic M3U playlists of your gallery. Instantly stream your videos to your Smart TV, phone, or VR headset. Includes "Quick Cast" for 1-click single-video streaming directly from the gallery, on-the-fly `.mkv` to `.mp4` transcoding, and rich metadata injection so premium VR players show your beautiful cover art and custom tags natively.

### ⚙️ Deep Configuration
*   **Dependency Management:** Built-in auto-detection for `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` with simple, cross-platform installation instructions and UI file-browsers if you use portable binaries.
*   **Bandwidth Throttling:** Limit download speeds (KB/s) so SauceBox doesn't choke your network.
*   **Format Selection:** Choose your preferred video container (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.webm`).
*   **Network Proxies:** Built-in proxy fields to bypass ISP and regional censorship effortlessly.
*   **System Integration:** Native desktop notifications when downloads finish or fail.
*   **Auto-Clear:** Automatically sweep completed videos from your active queue into your history.
*   **Safe-Guards:** Prevent full-disk errors with intelligent Free-Space Monitoring before downloads begin.
